## Mini Reflection

Name: Akin Edwards

I think my program is a level 4- because I made good use of OO programming and javaFX utilities to create a working wordle game with a few extra features. it is also diuvided into two classed as needed and has no major game breaking bugs.

The extra features I included in my program are: 
-End screen with changing colours based on win or loss
-replay button 
-Ability to delete letters with backspace
-Appealing UI
-no need to click on individual boxes to type
